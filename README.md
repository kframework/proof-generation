Matching Logic Proof Checker
----------------------------

This repository contains:

-   A formulation of [matching Î¼-logic](http://www.matching-logic.org/index.php/Matching_Logic) in Metamath
    (`theory/matching-logic-*.mm`)
-   A formalization of [Kore](https://github.com/kframework/kore) in matching logic (`theory/kore-*.mm`)
-   An interactive theorem prover specialized for matching logic (`ml/itp`), [more info](ml/itp)
-   A automated prover that can generate proofs of concrete rewriting in Kore,
    given a Kore definition and a trace

Dependencies
------------

The itp and rewrite prover use Python (3.7+). Some dependencies are required:

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

You would also need to build and install a custom version of K at [here](https://github.com/rod-lin/k/tree/matching-logic-proof-checker),
which uses a modified haskell backend to print extra proof hints for rewriting.

You could also try to use the current version of K but
you would need to add an extra flag `--no-backend-hints` for the `scripts.prove_symbolic`
script below.

The newer versions might **not** work since they may generate different axioms for rewriting.

Examples of generating proofs for concrete rewriting
----------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have a K definition `def.k` with the main module `MAIN`, and a
program `pgm.txt`, you can use

    python3 -m scripts.prove_symbolic def.k MAIN pgm.txt --output rewriting-proof

to generate the (concrete) rewriting proof for the program `pgm.txt` and output
to the `rewriting-proof` directory.

Once that's done, you can use Metamath to verify the proof:

    $ metamath rewriting-proof/goal.mm
